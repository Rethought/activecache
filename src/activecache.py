class ActiveCache(object):
    """
    Abstract class (requires an implementation of `refresh_cache`) that
    caches the result of `refresh_cache` and actively refreshes it whenever a
    trigger occurs (as managed by the implementation of `trigger`).

    The regeneration happens off thread and when complete the cache reference
    is updated. Thus there is never a block whilst a referesh happens.

    The trigger to refresh comes from a call to the blocking method
    `trigger` returning. This is called from a dedicated thread.

    It is important for thread safety that code using the cached object
    understands the reference can change at any time, so it should be
    bound to a name in the local namespace and then used, rather than
    referenced multiple times from the cahce in one routine.

    To make concrete, subclass and implement:

        This base implementation starts the watcher thread which blocks
        on `trigger`, calling `refresh_cache` each time the trigger returns.

        `start_immediate` means that the monitor thread will start on
        instantiation. If set True (the default), the monitor thread will start
        when `start()` is called or upon first request for the data value
        whereupon it will autostart.

        This is threadsafe - all callers during first refresh will be queued up
        and block until a first response is ready.
